## Lab - Detect Emotions in an Image with the Cognitive Services API 

### Introduction

Cognitive Service is a suite of APIs that allow you to take advantage of powerful algorithms to help you interpret and analyze graphics, text, and much more. 

In this lab, we'll be using the Azure Cognitive Services Face API and Python to determine which emotion a person is likely displaying in a particular photo. 

This lab will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete, and requires only novice python knowledge.

You can try it on a photo of yourself or use any photo from the internet by providing the URL.

### Sample Photos

If you don't want to use a photo of your own, you can test the API with one of these sample photos below. The URLs are provided in-code.
